# **Welcome!**

This is a website accompanying the MA thesis “Fighting for our Lives”. The 
primarily goal of this website is to create a place to document the data 
manipulation needed to produce my quantitative analysis. As such, this webpage 
is intended to add transparency to my thesis and make my research reproducible

# How can you use this website?

1. This webpage is organized on several tabs. You can click on each of them 
depending on what you would like to explore.

2. The code contained in this website is explained to the reader assuming that 
he/she does not have any prior experience coding on R. You can find explanations
in the text introducing each chunk of code and next to lines of code 
(introduced by a “#”). Sometimes, I decided to choose verbose code that can be 
easily understood my humans over “elegant” code. This decision was made in the 
spirit of making my research understandable to as many people as possible.

# Acknowledgements

This website is based on the code generously shared by doctor Matthew Crump. 
You can find his github here.

Likewise, I would like to acknowledge several people who helped during the 
research and writing processes of the dissertation associated with this website. 
The production of knowledge is never an individual task. I am grateful to my 
informants for being the kind co-producers of knowledge that allowed to get to 
know them and their struggles. I apologize in advance in case I have 
miss-interpreted any of your views.

Likewise, my own background as a social scientist means that I have not been 
trained to explore the impacts of “macrogranjas” on human and environmental 
health. To this end, I contacted members of Castilla la Mancha’s University 
(UCLM) who kindly helped me by providing me with relevant literature and 
correcting my misconceptions. I owe gratitude to Hugo, Lucía and Carmen from 
UCLM-Albacete’s Agrarian Engineering department for sending that literature 
across and chatting with me over coffee.

Similarly, the pulmonologist Jesus was of an invaluable help to understand the 
impact of industrial farming on human health. He sent me relevant papers and 
explained them to me. Likewise, I would not have been able to produce fieldwork 
without my parents. They renounced to their holidays and drove around CLM to do so.

Last, but by no means least, I would like to thank my supervisor at King’s 
College London (Doctor Pradella). She was a great role model who provided 
helpful and patient guidance throughout the whole process.
